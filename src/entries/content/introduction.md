---

As a Spanish-speaking law student, I have been on the Dean’s list for three out of four semesters with a rank of 60/263 (top 23%). As a student leader for four semesters, I have mentored 0Ls and 1Ls in their academic journey. I successfully manage a full-time career, family, and part-time law school with excellence and poise.
